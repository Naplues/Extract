Abstract: In this paper, the determinacy of regular lexical selectional restrictions is 
examined from both the internal structures of the single selectional restrictions (i.e. 
semantic selectional restrictions) and relationship between the structures of several 
selectional restrictions. Hence, our analysis and description are shifted from casual and 
indeterminate strings and markers on case basis to determined rules and circumspect 
dynamic systems, from lexical precepts to knowledge precepts, from the state of memory 
to rational deduction and rhetorical devices. Further studies indicate that selectional 
restrictions are intertwined structures, a feature that makes it possible to be one of the bases 
for lexical selectional restrictions to come into existence. Its related theories are the 
grarantee for scientific observations of selectional restriction structures. 
Keywords: lexical selectional restriction, determinacy, intertwine, basis for existence 
 
0. Introduction 
Both syntax and lexicology study lexical relationship from different perspectives. Syntax 
focuses on the abstract syntactic relations between lexicons in syntagmatic structures, while 
lexicology on precepts of interlexical relations. Starting from lexical restriction relationship, 
a hot topic in both syntax and lexicology, this paper is to demonstrate the determinacy and 
ontological basis for regular lexical selectional restrictions (if we put aside pure 
paradigmatic relation and super selectional restriction relation) by the analytical studies on 
the relations between internal determinacy and external determinacy of semantic
