Abstract：Jinwen Shangshu consists of the earliest documents handed down in China, and 
it is the classic of political history compiled no less than 2600 or 2500 years ago. The 
article makes a thorough analysis on object-preposed sentences, passive sentences, 
judgment sentences, and double-object sentences in Jinwen Shangshu (《今文尚书》). By 
comparing various sentence patterns and investigating them systematically combining with 
the development and the changes of the documentation language, it sums up some syntactic 
characteristics of Jinwen Shangshu as well as the the evolution law of syntactic forms in 
the documentation language, and it is of reference value to the study of the history of 
Chinese grammar. 
Keywords: Shangshu, Jinwen Shangshu, syntactic characteristics 
   
1. Introduction 
Most documents in Jinwen Shangshu are credible ancient texts of Shang (商) and Zhou 
(周) dynasties. Besides some narrative and descriptive texts, these documents mainly 
record words, and they belong to colloquial written language reflecting the language styles 
of Shang and Zhou dynasties relatively systematically. 
Jinwen Shangshu has many lexical features. For example, none of the forms of the 
self-addressing pronouns in the book is both single and plural, nor is its single or plural 
form marked with an added or deducted affix like that in modern Chinese. A 
self-addressing pronoun indicates its singular or plural by employing different lexical 
forms. Interjections and modal particles which are at the beginning or in the middle of the 
sentences are very rich, while modal particles at the end of the sentences are very poor. The 
book has neither “也(ye)” which is a high-frequency modal particle in classical Chinese 
nor the common modal particles “邪(耶)(ye)” and “与 (欤) (yu)”. [There is one case of 
“乎(hu, a modal particle)” in Yao Dian (《尧典》) only.] The interrogative mood is mainly

2. Object-preposed sentences present different forms 
(Yangzhou University, China) 
2.1 The uncommon form of negative object-preposed sentences : subject + 
 
pronoun object + negative word + verb predicate 
Abstract：Jinwen Shangshu consists of the earliest documents handed down in China, and 
Negative words strongly adhere to the preposed objects in negative sentences, and they 
it is the classic of political history compiled no less than 2600 or 2500 years ago. The 
are generally put in front of the preposed objects in Pre-Qin documents. The syntactic form 
article makes a thorough analysis on object-preposed sentences, passive sentences, 
is “negative word + pronoun object + verb predicate”, and most of the negative sentences 
judgment sentences, and double-object sentences in Jinwen Shangshu (《今文尚书》). By 
in Jinwen Shangshu are in this form. There are 12 such cases in the book, and except for 
comparing various sentence patterns and investigating them systematically combining with 
those, there are also 2 cases in which negative words are put after the pronoun objects as in 
the development and the changes of the documentation language, it sums up some syntactic 
(1a) and (2a) below:  
characteristics of Jinwen Shangshu as well as the the evolution law of syntactic forms in

form marked with an added or deducted affix like that in modern Chinese. A 
“(1a) means (1b). As (1a) is a negative object-preposed sentence, we can infer that (1b) 
self-addressing pronoun indicates its singular or plural by employing different lexical

废”(yì fèi), and the word “废(fèi)” in Bronze inscriptions means “法(fǎ)” mostly. “废(fèi)” 
sentences are very rich, while modal particles at the end of the sentences are very poor. The 
and “法(fǎ)” are interchangeable in ancient times. “易废(yì fèi)” is also “废易(fèi yì )” 
book has neither “也(ye)” which is a high-frequency modal particle in classical Chinese 
meaning “怠弃(dà i qì , to belittle or think little of )”. “时(shí )” is equal to the pronoun “是
nor the common modal particles “邪(耶)(ye)” and “与 (欤) (yu)”. [There is one case of 
(shì , „it‟)”, and the negative word “罔(wǎng, not)” is used after the pronoun object “时
“乎(hu, a modal particle)” in Yao Dian (《尧典》) only.] The interrogative mood is mainly 
(shí )”. Therefore, sentence (1a) can be interpreted into (1c).
