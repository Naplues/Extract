On Syntactic Characteristics of Jinwen Shangshu 
„Then addressed King Wu‟s great-grandfather, grandfather and father.‟ 
The semantic content and scope also have an influence on the choice of the verbs for the 
double objects. The objects of “问(wè n)” and “告(gà o)” are generally single, but the 
contents of “问(wè n)” and “告(gà o)” are complicated. Therefore, the semantic range of 
double-object verbs like “问(wè n)” and “告(gà o)” is much larger. For example, the direct 
object of the verb “告(gà o)” in Yu Xia Shu· Gan Shi (《虞夏书·甘誓》) is almost the whole 
text of the oath. The contents of “锡(xī)” and “降(jià ng)” can only be specific or abstract 
things, therefore, they have a smaller semantic range as the double-object verbs.
